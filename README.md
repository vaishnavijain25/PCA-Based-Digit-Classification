# Dimensionality Reduction for Digit Classification Using PCA


**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to reduce high-dimensional image data using PCA while maintaining accuracy in digit classification. By combining PCA and Logistic Regression, the model becomes faster and more efficient without losing predictive performance.

**Key Features**

  * Dimensionality reduction using PCA

  * Classification using Logistic Regression

  * Achieves high accuracy with fewer features

  * Visualization of explained variance and digits

  * Built with scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas

**Dataset**

  * Dataset: load_digits from sklearn.datasets

  * Samples: 1797

  * Features: 64 (8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits)

**Project Workflow**

  * Data Loading & Visualization

  * Data Standardization

  * Apply PCA (retain 95% variance)

  * Train-Test Split

  * Train Logistic Regression

  * Evaluate Model Accuracy

**Results**

  * Original Features: 64

  * Reduced to: ~25 principal components

  * Model Accuracy: ~95â€“97% on test data

 **Libraries used**
 
  * numpy

  * pandas

  * matplotlib

  * scikit-learn
